          <h1>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) advice for the public</h1>
          <article>
            <section>
              <p>
                Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
                available on the WHO website and through your national and local
                public health authority. Most countries around the world have
                seen cases of COVID-19 and many are experiencing outbreaks.
                Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in
                slowing their outbreaks. However, the situation is unpredictable
                so check regularly for the latest news.
              </p>

              <p>
                You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading
                COVID-19 by taking some simple precautions: Regularly and
                thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or
                wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with soap
                and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may
                be on your hands. Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance
                between yourself and others. Why? When someone coughs, sneezes,
                or speaks they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or
                mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can
                breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the
                person has the disease. Avoid going to crowded places.
              </p>

              <p>
                Why? Where people come together in crowds, you are more likely
                to come into close contact with someone that has COVID-19 and it
                is more difficult to maintain physical distance of 1 metre (3
                feet). Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. Why? Hands touch
                many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands
                can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,
                the virus can enter your body and infect you. Make sure you, and
                the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This
                means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or
                tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
                immediately and wash your hands. Why? Droplets spread virus. By
                following good respiratory hygiene, you protect the people
                around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19. Stay
                home and self-isolate even with minor symptoms such as cough,
                headache, mild fever, until you recover. Have someone bring you
                supplies. If you need to leave your house, wear a mask to avoid
                infecting others.
              </p>

              <h3>Protect yourself and others from the spread COVID-19</h3>

              <p>
                Avoiding contact with others will protect them from possible
                COVID-19 and other viruses. If you have a fever, cough and
                difficulty breathing, seek medical attention, but call by
                telephone in advance if possible and follow the directions of
                your local health authority. Why? National and local authorities
                will have the most up to date information on the situation in
                your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care
                provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.
                This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses
                and other infections. Keep up to date on the latest information
                from trusted sources, such as WHO or your local and national
                health authorities. Why? Local and national authorities are best
                placed to advise on what people in your area should be doing to
                protect themselves.
              </p>

              <p>
                o protect yourself and others against COVID-19, clean your hands
                frequently and thoroughly. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer or
                wash your hands with soap and water. If you use an alcohol-based
                hand sanitizer, make sure you use and store it carefully. Keep
                alcohol-based hand sanitizers out of children’s reach. Teach
                them how to apply the sanitizer and monitor its use. Apply a
                coin-sized amount on your hands. There is no need to use a large
                amount of the product. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose
                immediately after using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, as it
                can cause irritation. Hand sanitizers recommended to protect
                against COVID-19 are alcohol-based and therefore can be
                flammable. Do not use before handling fire or cooking. Under no
                circumstance, drink or let children swallow an alcohol-based
                hand sanitizer. It can be poisonous. Remember that washing your
                hands with soap and water is also effective against COVID-19.

                WHO discontinues hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir
                treatment arms for COVID-19!
              </h3>

              <p>
                WHO today accepted the recommendation from the Solidarity
                Trial’s International Steering Committee to discontinue the
                trial’s hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir arms. The
                Solidarity Trial was established by WHO to find an effective
                COVID-19 treatment for hospitalized patients. The International
                Steering Committee formulated the recommendation in light of the
                evidence for hydroxychloroquine vs standard-of-care and for
                lopinavir/ritonavir vs standard-of-care from the Solidarity
                trial interim results, and from a review of the evidence from
                all trials presented at the 1-2 July WHO Summit on COVID-19
                research and innovation.

                TA cluster of COVID-19 in Beijing, People’s Republic of China
              </p>

              <p>
                WHO is following up with Chinese authorities about a cluster of
                COVID-19 cases in Beijing, People’s Republic of China. Today,
                officials from the National Health Commission and Beijing Health
                Commission briefed WHO’s China country office, to share details
                of preliminary investigations ongoing in Beijing. As of 13 June,
                41 symptomatic laboratory confirmed cases and 46 laboratory
                confirmed cases without symptoms of COVID-19 have been
                identified in Beijing.
              </p>

              <p>
                The first identified case had symptom onset on 9 June, and was
                confirmed on 11 June. Several of the initial cases were
                identified through six fever clinics in Beijing. Preliminary
                investigations revealed that some of the initial symptomatic
                cases had a link to the Xinfadi Market in Beijing. Preliminary
                laboratory investigations of throat swabs from humans and
                environmental samples from Xinfadi Market identified 45 positive
                human samples (all without symptoms at the time of reporting)
                and 40 positive environmental samples. One additional case
                without symptoms was identified as a close contact of a
                confirmed case..
              </p>

              <p>
                All cases are in isolation and under care as needed, and contact
                tracing is underway. Genetic sequencing of samples is also
                underway and rapid sharing of these results is important to
                understand the origin of the cluster and links between cases.
                WHO has offered support and technical assistance, as well as
                requested further information about the cluster and the
                investigations underway and planned.
